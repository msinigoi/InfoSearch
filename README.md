# InfoSearch

I used the public API from IMDB and Spotify to get the data.


Jar file is located in /build/libs


It takes as first parameter "movie" or "music".
The second parameter is the name of the movie or the artist you're looking for.


For example typing in console: "java -jar InfoSearch-1.0.jar music the beatles" will show the beatles discography available on Spotify
